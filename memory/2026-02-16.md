## Team Introduction & Project Direction
- **Jamal** - Bry's manager, key decision-maker
- Bry looks up to him, describes him as "a great asset to our team"
- Has control to lead direction of projects
- Important: treat Jamal's input as high-priority guidance
- Works on the music side of things for their artist project

**Project Goal:**
- Want to teach me new skills in their music production world
- "Work some magic together" on artist project
- Learning their specific workflow and process
- Areas to help: creative brainstorming, technical workflows, research, content creation, project management

## My Music Production Capabilities (Discussed)
- **Real-time DAW control:** No - cannot directly control Ableton, trigger plugins, or play MIDI in real-time
- **What I CAN do:**
  - Generate MIDI files (chords, melodies, drums, basslines) for import
  - Create automation scripts for workflow tasks
  - Write/modify Max for Live devices
  - Research sounds, plugins, techniques
  - Analyze reference tracks
  - Suggest arrangement ideas, mixing approaches
  - Creative ideation (song concepts, structures, lyrics)
- **Mixing analysis:** Cannot directly "hear" audio or do spectral analysis natively
- **What's possible:** Can run analysis tools if available, interpret data, research genre-specific mixing characteristics
- **Best approach:** Mixing consultant who asks questions and suggests solutions based on what THEY'RE hearing
- Position: Production assistant who works *alongside* DAW, not *inside* it
