## Core Philosophy & Mindset

### Enhancement vs. Fixing
- **Not a fixing mindset** - it's an enhancement step, an extension of the artist's vision
- The goal is to **maximize what they were trying to do**, not perfect or analyze critically
- "How can I be a contributor to this process?"
- The main challenge: knowing **when to be aggressive and when to step out**

### The "Hot Girl at the Bar" Technique
- Don't make music "try too hard" to get attention
- **Enhance the magnetism** of the music - make it magnetic, not desperate
- The goal: allow listeners to **choose to come closer** to the music
- Take away the artist's insecurities and **elevate their stature**

### First Impressions Matter
- **"You only get to hear it for the first time once"** - Denny Purcell
- Stay fresh with the music - think like the audience (20-second listen, not producer's rabbit hole)
- Work quickly to maintain objectivity
- Want it to be **impactful now AND timeless in 20 years**

## Step-by-Step Process

### Initial Workflow (Single Track)

1. **Listen & Analyze** (without making changes yet)
   - Check frequency balances
   - Check instrumentation balances  
   - Assess dynamics parameters
   - Assess harmonic distortion
   - Intuit what they were trying to do

2. **Digital EQ First** (broad strokes)
   - Like sculpting - start with big block, shave your way in
   - Quick, broad adjustments
   - "Sculpture" analogy - coming in further with more detail

3. **Analog Chain** (or main processing)
   - One setting per record if possible (used to be one per song pre-2010)
   - Encapsulates where everything wants to go

4. **Refine with Digital EQ**
   - Section-by-section EQ adjustments
   - More detailed work

5. **Back to Analog** (if needed)
   - Adjust overview setting based on refined EQ

6. **Iterate**
   - Keep balancing digital and analog
   - Add and subtract - "building process"
   - Listen to results in context

### For Albums/Records

- **Balance diversity vs. cohesion**
  - Don't homogenize - keep uniqueness
  - But make it sound like one record
  - "How much do you make it the same and how much do you leave it different?"
  
- **Elevate all tracks equally**
  - Juggling analogy: get all sculptures (songs) as high as they can go
  - But keep them at the same strata so they hold together

## The Four Pillars of Mastering

1. **Frequency Balance** (EQ)
2. **Transient to Compression Balance** (compressors/limiters)
3. **Harmonic Distortion Balance** (saturation, color)
4. **Midside Power Balance** (width/depth)

These work together - not in isolation.

---

## EQ Techniques

### General EQ Philosophy

- **Get EQ right BEFORE compression/limiting**
  - Balanced frequency response = easier compression
  - Unbalanced frequencies trigger compression incorrectly
  - Clean up the balance first

- **EQ can happen before AND after dynamics**
  - You can compensate at multiple stages
  - Not limited to one approach

### Specific EQ Approaches

**Low End Shape - "The V"**

Three shapes:
1. **Deep V (Pop)** - very centered low end, thin sides (kick/bass centered, no low-end on sides)
2. **Medium V (Most music)** - some low-end/low-mid stuff on sides
3. **Wide V (Indie/rock)** - more low end on sides, more naturalistic "band in a room"

The shape is a **5-second indicator of style** to the listener.

**Common EQ Problems:**
- Too much bass OR not enough bass (most common corrective issue)
- Too bright/harsh (2-5k range) - common in all-digital workflows
- Upper mid-range stridence (makes things "apparently loud" but hurts musicality)

**Dynamic EQ**
- "Huge game changer for the last decade"
- Can boost specific ranges only when they hit threshold
- Example: 2k on vocals in mid-only, slight dynamic boost for movement
- FabFilter Pro-Q3 great for this

### Recommended EQs

**In The Box:**
- **Massenberg MDW** - Swiss Army knife, surgical or broadband (top choice for "only one EQ" challenge)
- **Metric Halo ChannelStrip** - great STC emulation
- **FabFilter Pro-Q3** - dynamic EQ, mid-side flexibility
- **Manley Massive Passive (UAD)** - musical, broadstroke
- **Weiss** - various models
- **Oxford** - from Sony Oxford console

**Analog (Hardware):**
- **GML 9500**
- **Fairman EQ** (all custom tubes, "best tube EQ ever made")
- **Focusrite EQ** (upgraded chips - 60x BurrBrown instead of 5534s, upgraded caps)

---

## Compression & Dynamics

### Compression Philosophy

- **Multiple compressors doing a little work each** > one compressor doing heavy work
  - Preserves transients and life
  - Example: Two compressors at 1dB each vs. one at 2-3dB

- **Compression can trigger differently based on frequency balance**
  - Fix frequency issues first
  - Broadband compression triggered by imbalances sounds wrong

### Limiter Techniques

**Placement:** Always last in the chain

**Gain Reduction:** Typically only 1-1.5dB at the final limiter (when signal is properly prepped)

**Prep Before Limiting:**
- Saturation
- Clipping
- Multiple stages of light compression
- Proper EQ balance

**When There's Too Much Limiting:**
- Transients disappear
- Gets flat, no front-to-back depth
- Drums right in your face (not in a cool way)
- Loss of bass response (the more limiting, the less bass)

### Recommended Compressors/Limiters

**In The Box:**
- **Weiss Deess Limiter (MML)** - not the DS1, the standalone
- **FabFilter** stuff
- **iZotope** stuff  
- **Oxford** plugs

**Analog:**
- **Alpha Compressor** (serial #1)
- **Overstayer** - pair of FET compressors (like matched 1176s but Jensen transformer, less aggressive)
- **SPL hardware** from the '90s

**Note:** Very few limiters are truly transparent - most have color even when used conservatively. Keep multiple options and choose based on the color you want.

## Loudness & Level

### Target Levels

- **"I don't have a target level. I'm antilfs."**
- There's a **window of acceptable loudness** - within that window, it's subjective
- Based on what feels musical and right for the record
- Dangers exist on BOTH ends: too hot AND too dynamic (for pop music)

### How to Sound Louder WITHOUT a Limiter

**Bad approach (don't do):**
- Goosing upper mid-range or brightness
- Makes it "apparently loud" but harsh and hurts ears
- Sacrifices bigness and low end

**Better approach:**
- Get the tonal balance right first
- Tighten low end so it's punchy but doesn't lag
- Use saturation tastefully
- Mid-side adjustments

### The Loudness Dilemma

- **"Anytime you make a song loud, you're changing it"**
- Some mixes sound great loud, some need space
- Very song and arrangement dependent
- Find the **sweet spot where it sounds loud enough but has good impact**
- Don't cross the point where distortion becomes too much
- Streaming normalization helps (less pressure to go super loud)

---

## Mid-Side Processing

### Width & Depth Control

**Lowering the sides can make things sound BIGGER and WIDER**
- Not intuitive, but it works
- Allows things to hit the limiter differently
- Creates more space and depth

**Mono Low End:**
- Tightens and focuses low end
- BUT can be **overused** - makes mix sound claustrophobic, less air
- Not a silver bullet
- Use the **Leapwing Stage One** plugin to "unmono" and add a little spread when needed

**Decoupling Left/Right on Limiter:**
- Similar concept to mid-side adjustments
- Sometimes makes things louder
- Frees things up, makes it sound looser and bigger
- Situation-dependent

---

## Groove & Movement

### How to Enhance Groove

1. **Get the right tonal balance first**
   - Combination of EQ, saturation, coloration
   - Enough tightness to clear muffling

2. **Identify what element in the groove needs enhancement**
   - Don't just apply tools blindly
   - Listen for what's holding the groove back

3. **Clean up problem areas**
   - Too much low end can SLOW the song (takes time to develop)
   - Tightening low end lets it come out nicely without lagging
   - Creates space for the snare to hit

**Tools for Groove:**
- Any mastering tool can work: EQ, compression, multiband, saturation
- **Coloration** can connect the sound to a sonic era (70s funk, 90s funk, etc.)

## Dealing with Problem Mixes

### Overcompressed/Over-Limited Mixes

**Cannot undo compression** - so damage control:

1. **Don't make it worse**
   - Be gentle with any additional limiting
   - Use most transparent limiting method

2. **Volume automation**
   - Build dynamics back in manually
   - Lower verses if they're as loud as choruses
   - Rebuild the natural dynamic arc

3. **EQ to restore transients**
   - Brighten sections where transients got squashed
   - Example: When chorus hits and compressor dips, EQ to compensate

4. **Politics matter**
   - Sometimes better to fix it yourself than ask for mix changes
   - "Like pulling a thread on a sweater - whole thing unravels"

### Common Mix Mistakes

1. **Topping/Tailing too aggressively**
   - Leave space at head and tail
   - Clipping the first transient is super common
   - Let the mastering engineer handle it

2. **Poor room acoustics**
   - #1 issue for less experienced mixers
   - Not sexy or fun, but **critical**
   - Get basic treatment: absorption in rear, bass trapping, first-order reflections
   - "If your room sounds good, your mixes will sound so much better right out of the gate"

3. **Bass response issues** (most common corrective EQ issue)
   - Way too much OR not enough

4. **Too bright/harsh** (digital workflows)
   - 2-5k range
   - Trying to "soften things up" is common in all-digital mixes

5. **Mono low-end overuse**
   - Makes mix sound claustrophobic, less air
   - Fix with subtle stereo spread in low end

## Mixing with Limiters on Master Bus

### Philosophy

**Use limiters for GLUE, not LEVEL:**
- If using for creative/glue purposes: **leave it on**, mastering engineer can't recreate that
- If using solely for competitive level: **turn it off** for mastering stems
- But send the limited version as a listening reference so everyone knows what they're used to

"Once you get into the realm of using those limiters solely for level, that's when you can turn it off for me."

---

## Emotions & Musicality

### Frequencies = Chakras

- **Low end** = groove
- **Low-mid** = heart
- **Mid/upper-mid** = vocal presence
- **Top end** = air/sheen

Balance these for the style and emotional intent.

### Connection to the Listener

**Goal:** Free people from the analytical prison of their mixing mindset
- Let them **hear the music for the first time** even if they've heard it 1000 times
- Remedy and upgrade the drama/trauma of making the song
- Listeners don't know if it was recorded analog or digital - they just feel the music

**The Main Thing:**
Make the music **magnetic** so people want to come closer to it.

## Technical Details

### Mastering Chain (In-The-Box)

**Typical Order:**
1. **MED plugin** (mid-side tool) - solo mid or sides for checking
2. **EQ** (digital)
3. **Compression**
4. **Saturation** (Oxford Inflator, etc.)
5. **Clipper** (if needed)
6. **Limiter** (always last)

**Alternative Chain:**
- EQ → Compression → EQ → more tweaks → final limiter
- Iterative, like sculpting

### Playback & Output

**ProTools** for creative work (plugins, processing)
**Pyramix** for final assembly, printing, output
- Amazing sample rate conversion & dither
- Easy DDP, high-res WAV, etc.
- Best for 2-channel editing

### Formats & Streaming

**No separate masters for different streaming services**
- Would need 10 different specs
- Specs change constantly
- **A great master transcends the service**
- Remastering exists for a reason - revisit in 20 years if needed

## Notes on Working Style

### Efficiency & Freshness

- **Work quickly** to stay objective
- Cursor skip a lot
- By first chorus, you know loud-to-soft range
- Start addressing most egregious issues immediately
- Singles: might listen 3-4 times and ready to print
- Take 10-15 min break before final print, reset ears

### Mental Notes vs. Written

- Mostly **mental notes**
- Only write notes for very long songs (prog rock, 15-18 min with multiple movements)
- "It's pretty obvious when you're listening to it what needs to be done"

### Thinking in Frequency Ranges, Not Tracks

- Don't think about "snare track" or "track four"
- Think in **frequency response ranges** or **energy areas**
- "Upper mid-range is too harsh" not "the snare needs..."

---

## For Beginners

### Starting Out Recommendations

**Plugin Suite:**
- **iZotope Ozone** - complete package, everything you need
- Or start with just **one good EQ and one limiter**

**Learning Path:**
1. Start with **ONLY equalization**
   - Don't worry about loudness or limiting at first
   - Turn monitor volume up if needed
   - **Focus solely on frequency balance**
   - Build EQ skill before adding compression/limiting
2. Then add compression/limiting once EQ is solid

**The Skill:**
It's all about EQ and dynamics working together, but learning them separately first builds the foundation.

## Rabbit Holes & Obsession

"I'm the guy that tests cables... AES cables on digital sound different. I've got certain tubes, certain fuses in amplifiers. Pretty much any rabbit hole you can think of, I've been down."

**Greg Wells:** "He's down every rabbit hole... he's just the rabbit."

The point: **The details matter**. Mastering is "a thousand subtle choices that add up to a wow."

## Key Takeaways

1. **Enhancement, not fixing** - maximize their vision
2. **Magnetism > trying too hard** - hot girl at the bar
3. **Balance is everything** - frequency, dynamics, mid-side, distortion
4. **EQ before dynamics** (usually)
5. **Multiple light compressors > one heavy**
6. **Limiter always last**, typically only 1-1.5dB GR
7. **First listen is precious** - stay fresh
8. **Groove comes from tonal balance + tightness**
9. **Low-end shape defines genre** in 5 seconds
10. **Great master = dimensionality**, not just volume
